      <p class="Intro">Carl Jung (1875 - 1961) was a psychologist and psychiatrist who founded <abbr title="Analytical psychology is a theory of human personality and thought that takes into account the individual unconscious and its relationship to the collective unconscious." >analytic psychology</abbr>, in
        some aspects a response to Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalysis. Jung proposed and developed the concepts of the

    <h2>Childhood</h2>
    <blockquote class="quote1">“Warmth is the vital element for the growing plant and for the soul of a child.”
    </blockquote>
    <div class="grid">
      <blockquote class="quote2">“In every adult there lurks a child— an eternal child, something that is always
        becoming, is never completed, and calls for unceasing care, attention, and education. That is the part of the
        personality which wants to develop and become whole.”</blockquote>
      <p>Carl Gustav Jung was born 26 July 1875 in Kesswil, in the Swiss canton of Thurgau, as the first surviving son
        of Paul Achilles Jung and Emilie Preiswerk.<br> Jung was the son of a philologist and pastor. His childhood was
        lonely, although enriched by a vivid imagination, and from an early age he observed the behaviour of his parents
        and teachers, which he tried to resolve.<br> Confronted with the reality of his family's poverty, he realized
        the need for academic excellence.</p>

    <h2>University studies and early career</h2>
    <blockquote class="quote1">“Everyone you meet knows something you don’t know but need to know. Learn from them.”
    </blockquote>
    <div class="grid">
      <blockquote class="quote3">“The world will ask you who you are, and if you don't know, the world will tell you.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>Initially, Jung had aspirations of becoming a preacher or minister. There was a strong moral sense in his
        household and several of his family were clergymen Jung had wanted to study archaeology, but his family could
        not afford to send him further than the University of Basel, which did not teach it. After studying philosophy
        in his teens, Jung decided against the path of religious traditionalism and decided to pursue psychiatry and
        medicine. His interest was captured—it combined the biological and spiritual, exactly what he was searching for.
        In 1895 Jung began to study medicine at the University of Basel. Barely a year later, his father Paul died and
        left the family near destitute.<br /><br /> It was during this early period, when Jung was an assistant at the
        Anatomical Institute at Basel University, that he took an interest in palaeoanthropology and the revolutionary
        discoveries of Homo erectus and Neanderthal fossils. These formative experiences contributed to his fascination
        with the evolutionary past of humanity and his belief that an ancient evolutionary layer in the psyche,
        represented by early fossil hominins, is still evident in the psychology of modern humans.</p>

      <blockquote class="quote4">“One looks back with appreciation to the brilliant teachers, but with gratitude to
        those who touched our human feelings.”</blockquote>
      <p>In 1900, Jung moved to Zürich and was fortunate in joining the staff of the Burghölzli Asylum of the University
        of Zürich at a time (1900) when it was under the direction of Eugen Bleuler, whose psychological interests had
        initiated what are now considered classical studies of mental illness. Bleuler was already in communication with
        the Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud.<br /> <br />
        At Burghölzli, Jung began, with outstanding success, to apply association tests initiated by earlier
        researchers.
        These researches, which established him as a psychiatrist of international repute, led him to understand Freud’s
        investigations. His findings confirmed many of Freud’s ideas.

      <p class="marriage">In 1903, Jung married Emma Rauschenbach (1882–1955), seven years his junior and the elder
        daughter of a wealthy industrialist in eastern Switzerland. Emma Jung, whose education had been limited, evinced
        considerable ability and interest in her husband's research and threw herself into studies and acted as his
        assistant at Burghölzli. She eventually became a noted psychoanalyst in her own right. The marriage lasted until
        Emma died in 1955. They had five children:<br /><br />
        Agathe Niehus, born on December 28, 1904<br /><br />
        Gret Baumann, born on February 8, 1906<br /><br />

    <h2>Relationship with Freud</h2>
    <blockquote class="quote1">“Wisdom accepts that all things have two sides.”</blockquote>
    <div class="grid">
      <blockquote class="quote6">Psychoanalysis developed by Sigmund Freud is a type of treatment based on the theory
        that our present is shaped by our past.</blockquote>
      <p>In the early 1900s psychology as a science was still in its early stages, but Jung became a qualified proponent
        of Freud's new "psycho-analysis". Freud needed collaborators and pupils to validate and spread his ideas. Jung
        sent Freud a copy of his Studies in Word Association in 1906.<br />
        Preceded by a lively correspondence, Jung met Freud for the first time in Vienna on 3 March 1907. Jung recalled
        the discussion between himself and Freud as interminable, unceasing for 13 hours.<br /><br />
        Six months later, the then 50-year-old Freud sent a collection of his latest published essays to Jung in Zurich.
        This marked the beginning of an intense correspondence and collaboration that lasted five years (between 1907
        and 1912).<br /><br />
        Jung held important positions in the psychoanalytic movement and was widely thought of as the most likely
        successor to the founder of psychoanalysis Freud. But this was not to be the outcome of their relationship.
        Partly for temperamental reasons and partly because of differences of viewpoint, the collaboration ended.
      <p>

    <h2>Midlife isolation</h2>
    <blockquote class="quote1">
      “If a man knows more than others, he becomes lonely.”</blockquote>
    <div class="grid">
      <blockquote class="quote5">“The highest, most decisive experience is to be alone with one’s own self. You must be
        alone to find out what supports you, when you find that you can not support yourself. Only this experience can
        give you an indestructible foundation.”</blockquote>
      <p>It was the publication of Jung's book "The Psychology of the Unconscious" in 1912 that led to the final break
        with Freud. The letters they exchanged show Freud's refusal to consider Jung's ideas. This rejection caused what
        Jung described in his posthumously-published autobiography, as a "resounding censure". Everyone he knew dropped
        away from him, except two of his colleagues.<br /><br />
        Jung spoke at meetings of the Psycho-Medical Society in London in 1913 and 1914. His travels were soon
        interrupted by the war, but his ideas continued to receive attention in England primarily through the efforts of
        Constance Long who translated and published the first English volume of his collected writings.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Wartime army service</h2>
    <blockquote class="quote1">“To a quite terrifying degree we are threatened by wars and revolutions which are nothing
      other than psychic epidemics. At any moment several million human beings may be smitten with a new madness, and
      then we shall have another world war”</blockquote>
    <div class="grid">
      <p>During World War I, Jung was drafted as an army doctor and soon made commandant of an internment camp for
        British officers and soldiers. The Swiss were neutral and obliged to intern personnel from either side of the
        conflict, who crossed their frontier to evade capture. Jung worked to improve the conditions of soldiers
        stranded in Switzerland and encouraged them to attend university courses.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Travels</h2>
    <blockquote class="quote1">"Do not compare, do not measure. No other way is like yours. All other ways deceive and
      tempt you. You must fulfill the way that is in you.”</blockquote>
    <div class="grid">
      <p>Jung emerged from his period of isolation in the late nineteen-tens with the publication of several journal
        articles, followed in 1921 with "Psychological Types", one of his most influential books. There followed a
        decade of active publication, interspersed with overseas travels to England, United State, East Africa and
        India.<br /><br />
        Jung became seriously ill on his trip to India in 1938 and endured two weeks of delirium in a Calcutta hospital.
        After 1938, his travels were confined to Europe.</p>

    <h2>Later life and death</h2>
    <blockquote class="quote1">“The sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light of meaning in the darkness of
      mere being.”</blockquote>
    <div class="grid">

      <p>
        His historical studies aided him in pioneering the psychotherapy of the middle-aged and elderly, especially
        those who felt their lives had lost meaning. He helped them to appreciate the place of their lives in the
        sequence of history.<br /><br />
        In later years he became professor of psychology at the Federal Polytechnical University in Zürich (1933–41) and
        a full professor of medical psychology at the University of Basel in 1943, but resigned after a heart attack the
        next year to lead a more private life.<br /><br />
        In 1945, he began corresponding with an English Roman Catholic priest, Father Victor White, who became a close
        friend, regularly visiting the Jungs at the Bollingen estate. According to some, Jung's greatest letters were
        written to White. Jung became ill again in 1952.<br /><br />
        Jung continued to publish books until the end of his life. In 1961, he wrote his last work, a contribution to
        Man and His Symbols entitled "Approaching the Unconscious" (published posthumously in 1964).<br /><br />
        Jung died on 6 June 1961 at Küsnacht after a short illness. He had been beset by circulatory diseases.
